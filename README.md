# Timetabling System
This is a project for 3rd Year Software Development module Graph Theory, using graph database management system Neo4j.  
The [Design Document](https://github.com/rebeccabernie/TimetablingSystem/blob/master/DesignDocument.md) contains a detailed account of decisions made and design logic behind the datatbase, as well as some example queries.

### Goals
The goal of this project is to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use in a timetabling system for a third level institute, such as Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  

The database should store information about student groups/years, classrooms, lecturers and subjects.  

### Structure   

For demonstration purposes, I will be focusing on the Software Development Level 7 (Year 3) and course. The database will contain information about the *current* semester - i.e. Spring/Summer.

The finished prototype looks as follows:

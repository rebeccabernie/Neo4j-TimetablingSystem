# Timetabling System
This is a project for 3rd Year Software Development module Graph Theory, using graph database management system [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/).  

The [Design Document](https://github.com/rebeccabernie/TimetablingSystem/blob/master/DesignDocument.md) contains a detailed account of decisions made and design logic behind the database, as well as some example queries.

### Goals
The goal of this project is to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use in a timetabling system for a third level institute, such as Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. The database should store information about student groups/years, classrooms, lecturers and subjects, and any other relevant information.  

> Database password, if needed: timetable

The finished prototype looks as follows:

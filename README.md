# Timetabling System
This is a project for 3rd Year Software Development module Graph Theory, using graph database management system Neo4j.  

### Goals
The goal of this project is to design and prototype a Neo4j database for use in a timetabling system for a third level institute, such as Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  

The database should store information about student groups/years, classrooms, lecturers and subjects.  

### Structure   

For demonstration purposes, I will be focusing on the Software Development Level 7 (Years 1 to 3) and Level 8 (Year 4) course. The database will contain information about the *current* semester for each year - i.e. Spring/Summer.
